# Click a Tarot Card.

## Why this type of app?
  I have a couple of tarot decks. I was already interested in the subject. My decks are not Rider Waite Tarot Deck. My tarot decks are based of the Arthurian Legends and the other is based on Hermeticism. Rider Waite's Deck is a very common and mostly known deck. It seemed natural to create an app based off of my interest of tarot.
  
## How did I approach this app?
  I started out with a couple sketches of what I wanted my app to look like. Based on my sketch, I handwritten a wireframe before going over it once more to group certain elements within divs to make it much easier to access them and/or design them with CSS.
  - The API i had used is from this link (https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api)

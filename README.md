# Click a Tarot Card.

## Why this type of app?
  I have a couple of tarot decks. I was already interested in the subject. My decks are not Rider Waite Tarot Deck. My tarot decks are based of the Arthurian Legends and the other is based on Hermeticism. Rider Waite's Deck is a very common and mostly known deck. It seemed natural to create an app based off of my interest of tarot.

## How did I approach this app?
  1. I started out with a couple sketches of what I wanted my app to look like. Based on my sketch, I handwritten a wireframe before going over it once more to group certain elements within divs to make it much easier to access them and/or design them with CSS.
  2. I found the API that works and I like for the app. The API i had used is from this link (https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api)
  3. I tested the API and then began logging each different aspect I could with this API to understand how to access the information I would need for this app.
  4. I had noticed that this API did not include images of the R.W. Tarot cards. Therefore, the first thing I did was find all the images of the cards and placed them in a directory, the imgs directory.
  5. At this point, my documents are linked, the basic wireframe has been coded, the API is linked, I had noted the syntax needed to access the information in the API. I began to create a checklist of things that needed to be down in order for this app to reach MVP.
  ##### Checklist:
- [ ] Create an APP Name
- [x] Find the images of the Card Faces.
- [x] Create the Draw Button
- [x] Make the card-back clickable to 'flip' it
- [x] Make the card-image clickable to open a modal
- [x] Allow modal to change information needed to match the drawn card.

### Putting my Approach to action:
  1. I find it extremely helpful to handwrite my code with the tags color coded because while writing them by hand helps with understanding syntax and I would have to completely understand what I am handwriting. I, personally, feel that I have a disconnect with my creative side of my brain while typing,I feel a certain permanence while typing, regardless of the backspace.
  2. I took each point of my short checklist and broke it down even smaller on my sheet of paper. I wrote down a couiple coding ideas before testing them. This slows down my thought process so I do not skip and/or jump a couple steps ahead that can lead to the code breaking which will send me panicking. ]
  3. For each step I took, I tested it, and took a little break. The little break consists of walking to the kitchen, finding a snack, talking to my dog, checking on the garden, soaking in the sun, etc. before coming back to work on the next step.
  4. Due to my weakness in CSS, I did CSS alongside coding so I don't work on CSS on the end and become frustrated when something does not line up.

## Unsolved Problems:
  1. How to randomize which card is flipped or not. Tarot cards have different meanings when they are reversed. I wanted to add them into the the modal. However, I couldn't figure out a way to make the cards randomly rotate 180degrees. I am still trying to add that feature but at the moment, I am trying to add background information about the deck that is being used and the history behind the cards and tarot itself.

## Spice up the APP:
  1. The app so far is pretty plain even with the colors and the different fonts. I am going to add an about, explanation/introduction to Tarot and the history behind this type of deck and why it is so commonly known and used. Perhaps whilst I spice up the app, a name for the app will come to me. I would appreciate a pun app name but if not, I can settle with a short and to-the-point name.
  2. I'll see if I can add three cards that could be added into the reading.
  3. Usually cards have to be read together to get the answer in response to the question asked by the reader but it will be up to the user. The introduction part of this app will allow the reader to learn this.
